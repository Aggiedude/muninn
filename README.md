# Muninn

Our goal for Muninn is to be a mid-range cost drone that combines the ease of use of the follower drones with the sophisticated camera operation of the more expensive platforms, with general purpose outdoor photography and videography as the expected usage. With this in mind, we have developed the following list of objectives.

##Objectives:

###Useful Imaging Ability
- 10+ Minutes of in-air video capture
- Quality outdoor image capture

###Hands-off Use
- Configurable via mobile app
- No need for constant monitoring
- Multiple modes of autopilot flight patterns
- Multiple modes for camera movement

###Safety and Reliability
- Safe take-off/landing
- Durable to withstand low impact landings
